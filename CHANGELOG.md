# Changelog

All notable changes to MetriplecticRelaxation.jl are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This repository begins with this file, so there is no history predating it and nothing has been
reconstructed from `git log`.

Two rules specific to an experiment repository, and they are the reason this file matters more
here than in a library:

- **When a measured number changes, the entry says why** — a fix, a dependency bump, a different
  tolerance, a different machine. A results table that silently differs from last month's is the
  failure this prevents.
- **Every choice the paper leaves open is recorded next to the number it produced.** The published
  §5 runs state no time step, no final time, no stopping criterion and no solver tolerance; each
  one picked here is a choice, not a datum, and is written down as such.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`src/torus.jl` — the §4 problem definition.** The periodic domain, the anisotropic Gaussian
  of `eq:initial_gaussian`, the prescribed Hamiltonian `h = cos²x₁ sin²x₂` of `eq:islands-h`,
  the closed-form entropy minimisers of both test cases, and the contour geometry behind the
  relaxation time. Deliberately free of any discretisation, so that the spectral and the spline
  solver are two independent solvers of the *same* stated problem and their agreement is
  evidence about the equation rather than about a shared code path.

  **`τ_h` has a closed form, which the manuscript does not give.** `eq:relaxation-time` defines
  `ℓ_h = ∮ ds/|∇h|` and says it can be estimated "from a sample of points on the considered
  contour", obtained by integrating the flow of `X_h`. For this particular `h` it can be had
  exactly. On the island centred at `(π, π/2)`, writing `s = x₁−π` and `t = x₂−π/2` gives
  `h = cos²s cos²t`, and the substitution `sin s = √(1−h) sin θ` maps the contour integral onto
  the complete elliptic integral of the first kind:

      ℓ_h = (2/√h) K(1−h) = π / (√h · agm(1,√h))     τ_h = 1 / (4h · agm(1,√h)²)

  Both limits the manuscript describes in words fall out: `τ_h → 1/4` at the island centre —
  which is also the period `π` of the harmonic approximation `h ≈ 1−s²−t²`, whose flow rotates
  at angular frequency 2 — and `τ_h → ∞` logarithmically at the separatrix. This is an exact
  reference where the paper has a sampled estimate, so A1's `τ_h` check is against a closed form
  rather than against another numerical procedure.

  **Recorded choice — the final time `T`, which the manuscript never states.** `Δt` is the
  paper's own (`1e-4` for A1, `1e-3` for A2–A4). For the reduced Euler runs Fig. 6 places the
  vertex of the cone at `t ≈ 5`, so `T = 10` is taken, leaving as much trajectory again past the
  vertex to measure the asymptotic rates on. A1 has no such landmark and is given `T = 20`,
  which is 80 `τ_h` at an island centre and resolves the island interiors while leaving the
  separatrix stalled — the behaviour Fig. 1 shows.

  **Recorded choice — the Gaussian is not periodised.** The manuscript writes
  `eq:initial_gaussian` unmodified on `T²`, with no summation over images, so this does too. The
  resulting jump across the boundary is `1e-69` for §4.1's `w₂ = 0.4` but `5.2e-5` for the
  `w₂ = 1` of the reduced Euler runs. Both discretisations absorb it the same way, so it does
  not bias the spectral-versus-spline comparison, but it does put a floor under how well either
  represents the stated initial condition.

- **`scripts/verify_torus_geometry.jl`** — 24 checks on that geometry, run before any solver was
  built on it. The closed form agrees with quadrature of the arclength integral to **9e-16 …
  8.7e-15** over `h ∈ [1e-5, 0.9]`; `ℓ_h` is confirmed to be the *period* of the `X_h` flow, the
  manuscript's own characterisation, with the orbit closing to **1.6e-14**; and the contour
  average reproduces a field that is already a function of `h` to **1e-12** and agrees with the
  flow-time average to **8.6e-14**. Two controls that must fail do fail: `agm(1,h)` in place of
  `agm(1,√h)` is off by **16 %**, and after half a period the orbit has moved **1.57**.

### Fixed

- **A catastrophic cancellation in the contour quadrature, found by its own refinement check.**
  The direct parameterisation forms `sin t = √(1 − h/cos²s)`, whose bracket is a difference of
  two nearly equal numbers at the turning points, where `cos²s → h`. Near the separatrix that
  cost most of the mantissa: at `h = 1e-4` the residual against the closed form was **1.3e-10**
  and *grew* with the node count — `1.6e-11` at `n = 200` rising to `4.6e-9` at `n = 3200` —
  which is the signature of round-off rather than of truncation, and is what identified the
  cause instead of prompting a wider tolerance.

  The cure is algebraic and exact: `cos²s = h + (1−h)cos²θ` and `sin t = √(1−h)|cos θ|/cos s`
  are both sums of positive terms with no cancellation anywhere. The residual fell to
  **2.1e-15** at `h = 1e-4` and now stays at round-off down to `h = 1e-5`, so the check runs at
  a `1e-13` tolerance rather than the `1e-10` that the defective version could not meet.

- **The repository itself.** Scaffolding only: `Project.toml` with the dependency set the
  reproduction needs and hand-written `[compat]` bounds, the `src/` – `scripts/` – `test/` layout
  with root-anchored `/runs` and `/results` in `.gitignore`, the `Checks` PASS/FAIL harness copied
  from PoissonBrackets' `scripts/check.jl`, an empty `scripts/run_all.jl` driver list, and the
  shared CI workflows and git hooks installed from `~/Research/Knowledge/AI/githooks/`. No physics,
  no brackets and no run drivers yet.

  The `julia` floor is **1.11**, not the 1.10 used across the rest of the tree: `PoissonBrackets`
  and `SimpleSplines` are both unregistered and are reached through a `[sources]` table, which
  Julia 1.10 ignores rather than honours, so a 1.10 environment fails to resolve rather than
  resolving to something older.

  Both sources are **paths to the local siblings**, not `{rev = "main", url = …}`. That follows
  the rule `PoissonBrackets/scripts/Project.toml` already states — the url form resolves against
  a cached clone and pins the environment to whatever was last fetched — and it is also the only
  form that resolves here at all: Julia 1.13.0-rc3's `Pkg` segfaults (signal 11) in
  `Updating git-repo` for a git-url source, offline as well as online and with the cached clone
  already at the current commit.
