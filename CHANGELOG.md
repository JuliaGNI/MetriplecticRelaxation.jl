# Changelog

All notable changes to MetriplecticRelaxation.jl are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This repository begins with this file, so there is no history predating it and nothing has been
reconstructed from `git log`.

Two rules specific to an experiment repository, and they are the reason this file matters more
here than in a library:

- **When a measured number changes, the entry says why** — a fix, a dependency bump, a different
  tolerance, a different machine. A results table that silently differs from last month's is the
  failure this prevents.
- **Every choice the paper leaves open is recorded next to the number it produced.** The published
  §5 runs state no time step, no final time, no stopping criterion and no solver tolerance; each
  one picked here is a choice, not a datum, and is written down as such.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **The repository itself.** Scaffolding only: `Project.toml` with the dependency set the
  reproduction needs and hand-written `[compat]` bounds, the `src/` – `scripts/` – `test/` layout
  with root-anchored `/runs` and `/results` in `.gitignore`, the `Checks` PASS/FAIL harness copied
  from PoissonBrackets' `scripts/check.jl`, an empty `scripts/run_all.jl` driver list, and the
  shared CI workflows and git hooks installed from `~/Research/Knowledge/AI/githooks/`. No physics,
  no brackets and no run drivers yet.

  The `julia` floor is **1.11**, not the 1.10 used across the rest of the tree: `PoissonBrackets`
  and `SimpleSplines` are both unregistered and are reached through a `[sources]` table, which
  Julia 1.10 ignores rather than honours, so a 1.10 environment fails to resolve rather than
  resolving to something older.
